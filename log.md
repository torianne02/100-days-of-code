# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I made the final touches on a project by reviewing my code, testing the code to double check all variables that are declared are being used, and confirming that I made use of ES6 syntax. I also completed 2 Javascript Kata's on Codewars.

**Thoughts**: I am happy to be completing the basic requirements of this project, but even more excited about the fact that my mind is constantly rolling with new ideas/features I could add to it in the future.

### Day 2: January 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I completed 6 Kata's on Codewars, in Javascript and Ruby.

**Thoughts**: I have felt like I need some practice communicating my code and thought processes while trying to work through a problem, so I volunteered my fiance to verbally work through a few Kata's with me. It was very helpful to learn what to say and not to say. It was also great getting in the practice of coding through a few problems with a partner.

### Day 3: January 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: My fiance, a data engineer, did a quick SQL refresher with me. We then spent the next hour and a half working on SQL problems on codewars and W3Schools. We also completed a SQL quiz on W3Schools, as well as a JS one.

**Thoughts**: I learned SQL in my bootcamp at Flatiron and felt really comfortable working with SQLite within Ruby. It was really nice getting to work with SQL statements again after a few months of putting it on the back burner and still knowing/remembering how it all works. It felt like I was brushing off the cob webs.

### Day 4: January 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I spent the day working on my REACT portfolio project for Flatiron. I focused on my rails API backend. I spent a lot of time reading up on how to call an external API within rails.

**Thoughts**: Today was frustrating. I had a difficult time finding documents that were helpful. Once I did, I felt burnt out. I didn't make as much progress as I wish I would have, but that's okay. We learn from the bad days most.

### Day 5: January 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today, I worked on my REACT portfolio project again. I finished creating my external API call via backend (rails). I then created the frontend repo for this project. I learned how to install and the usefulness of react-router.

**Thoughts**: Getting my one hour of code in today was a little stressful, as I am preparing for my mock cultural interview with Flatiron. The morning and early afternoon flew by so quickly that I completely lost track of time. Time management skills need a little bit more work, but what I did get to code was interesting and I learned a few new things.

### Day 6: January 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today, I was getting a little confused while trying to work on my REACT project for Flatiron, so I decided to turn to Google. There I found and went through the REACT tic-tac-toe tutorial.

**Thoughts**: I really enjoyed the tutorial today and plan to work through the extra steps that they mention at the end.

### Day 7: January 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Yesterday I scheduled my mock technical interview, so today I spent my hour working on Ruby Katas on Codewars.

**Thoughts**: I did 2 problems with regex and it was really frustrating. Regex has always been something I have had difficulty working with, so today was great practice.

### Day 8: January 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked through w3schools SQL exercises. I also worked on my Rails API for my Hikester web-application.

**Thoughts**: I felt productive and great going through the SQL exercises. I felt the complete and total opposite once I started working on my project. I am feeling foggy in the head today and having a hard time processing next steps. I am choosing to put it down at the moment and I'll pick it back up tomorrow with a hopefully clear head.

### Day 9: January 12, 2019
**Today's Progress**: I did a lot of research in regards to how to develop my components for my React project. I spoke out loud with my fiance about my plans and why I'd like to do it the way I want too.

**Thoughts**: I felt pretty bad that I did no live coding. I dedicated an hour of my day to the pseudo-code for my project and learning to discuss my thought processes out loud. I feel it was beneficial.

### Day 10: January 13, 2019
**Today's Progress**: I decided to spend time working on more Ruby Kata's on Codewars.

**Thoughts**: The problems on Codewars today were challenging and required me to think deeply and arithmetically, which I'm not accustomed to. I really thought it was a great learning eperience.

### Day 11: January 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Tomorrow I have a Javascript assessment for my JS final project. I decided to spend the day today studying and practicing variable hoisting and function hoisting. I did all my practice problems using repl.it.

**Thoughts**: I really feel like I've got a grasp on both variable and function hoisting in JS. Hopefully my assessment tomorrow goes really well!

### Day 12: January 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I had the first half of my assessment for Javascript. I had to walk through my project and do some live coding. I was tasked with adding a 'sort' button to the current users beer list. I created an event listener using jQuery and retrieved the JSON data needed via an AJAX call. I then used existing code to display the information onto the view page. I also studied more for the JS fundamental portion of the assessment.

**Thoughts**: I feel so incredibly great about this assessment. I knew what I was doing and felt confident. The instructor told me afterwards that he was impressed with my live coding skills and that I did a particularly great job at articulating my thought process. Overall, I'm very pleased and ending the day feeling confident. Part 2 of my assessment is tomorrow.

### Day 13: January 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I had the second half of my assessment for Javascript. The second half is geared towards JS/ES6 fundamentals. We reviewed arrow functions, variable declarations using var, const, and let, hoisting, scope, this, and closures. I have also worked on a whole entire new REACT project and getting that API call sorted out.

**Thoughts**: I PASSED MY ASSESSMENT! If the all caps doesn't already say it, I am so ecstatic to finally be finished with this section. I hit so many bumps in the road during this project and I am glad to be moving on to the next section. One step closer to graduation!! Also, the instructor said I did an outstanding job today and was impressed with how prepared I was. My confidence is through the roof at the moment. Now, excuse me while I go ride on this high for the rest of the day!
