# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I made the final touches on a project by reviewing my code, testing the code to double check all variables that are declared are being used, and confirming that I made use of ES6 syntax. I also completed 2 Javascript Kata's on Codewars.

**Thoughts**: I am happy to be completing the basic requirements of this project, but even more excited about the fact that my mind is constantly rolling with new ideas/features I could add to it in the future.

### Day 2: January 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I completed 6 Kata's on Codewars, in Javascript and Ruby.

**Thoughts**: I have felt like I need some practice communicating my code and thought processes while trying to work through a problem, so I volunteered my fiance to verbally work through a few Kata's with me. It was very helpful to learn what to say and not to say. It was also great getting in the practice of coding through a few problems with a partner.

### Day 3: January 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: My fiance, a data engineer, did a quick SQL refresher with me. We then spent the next hour and a half working on SQL problems on codewars and W3Schools. We also completed a SQL quiz on W3Schools, as well as a JS one.

**Thoughts**: I learned SQL in my bootcamp at Flatiron and felt really comfortable working with SQLite within Ruby. It was really nice getting to work with SQL statements again after a few months of putting it on the back burner and still knowing/remembering how it all works. It felt like I was brushing off the cob webs.

### Day 4: January 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I spent the day working on my REACT portfolio project for Flatiron. I focused on my rails API backend. I spent a lot of time reading up on how to call an external API within rails.

**Thoughts**: Today was frustrating. I had a difficult time finding documents that were helpful. Once I did, I felt burnt out. I didn't make as much progress as I wish I would have, but that's okay. We learn from the bad days most.

1. [Hikester API](https://github.com/torianne02/hikester-api)

### Day 5: January 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today, I worked on my REACT portfolio project again. I finished creating my external API call via backend (rails). I then created the frontend repo for this project. I learned how to install and the usefulness of react-router.

**Thoughts**: Getting my one hour of code in today was a little stressful, as I am preparing for my mock cultural interview with Flatiron. The morning and early afternoon flew by so quickly that I completely lost track of time. Time management skills need a little bit more work, but what I did get to code was interesting and I learned a few new things.

### Day 6: January 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today, I was getting a little confused while trying to work on my REACT project for Flatiron, so I decided to turn to Google. There I found and went through the REACT tic-tac-toe tutorial.

**Thoughts**: I really enjoyed the tutorial today and plan to work through the extra steps that they mention at the end.

### Day 7: January 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Yesterday I scheduled my mock technical interview, so today I spent my hour working on Ruby Katas on Codewars.

**Thoughts**: I did 2 problems with regex and it was really frustrating. Regex has always been something I have had difficulty working with, so today was great practice.

### Day 8: January 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked through w3schools SQL exercises. I also worked on my Rails API for my Hikester web-application.

**Thoughts**: I felt productive and great going through the SQL exercises. I felt the complete and total opposite once I started working on my project. I am feeling foggy in the head today and having a hard time processing next steps. I am choosing to put it down at the moment and I'll pick it back up tomorrow with a hopefully clear head.

### Day 9: January 12, 2019
**Today's Progress**: I did a lot of research in regards to how to develop my components for my React project. I spoke out loud with my fiance about my plans and why I'd like to do it the way I want too.

**Thoughts**: I felt pretty bad that I did no live coding. I dedicated an hour of my day to the pseudo-code for my project and learning to discuss my thought processes out loud. I feel it was beneficial.

1. [Hikester API](https://github.com/torianne02/hikester-api)

### Day 10: January 13, 2019
**Today's Progress**: I decided to spend time working on more Ruby Kata's on Codewars.

**Thoughts**: The problems on Codewars today were challenging and required me to think deeply and arithmetically, which I'm not accustomed to. I really thought it was a great learning eperience.

### Day 11: January 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Tomorrow I have a Javascript assessment for my JS final project. I decided to spend the day today studying and practicing variable hoisting and function hoisting. I did all my practice problems using repl.it.

**Thoughts**: I really feel like I've got a grasp on both variable and function hoisting in JS. Hopefully my assessment tomorrow goes really well!

### Day 12: January 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I had the first half of my assessment for Javascript. I had to walk through my project and do some live coding. I was tasked with adding a 'sort' button to the current users beer list. I created an event listener using jQuery and retrieved the JSON data needed via an AJAX call. I then used existing code to display the information onto the view page. I also studied more for the JS fundamental portion of the assessment.

**Thoughts**: I feel so incredibly great about this assessment. I knew what I was doing and felt confident. The instructor told me afterwards that he was impressed with my live coding skills and that I did a particularly great job at articulating my thought process. Overall, I'm very pleased and ending the day feeling confident. Part 2 of my assessment is tomorrow.

### Day 13: January 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I had the second half of my assessment for Javascript. The second half is geared towards JS/ES6 fundamentals. We reviewed arrow functions, variable declarations using var, const, and let, hoisting, scope, this, and closures. I have also worked on a whole entire new REACT project and getting that API call sorted out.

**Thoughts**: I PASSED MY ASSESSMENT! If the all caps doesn't already say it, I am so ecstatic to finally be finished with this section. I hit so many bumps in the road during this project and I am glad to be moving on to the next section. One step closer to graduation!! Also, the instructor said I did an outstanding job today and was impressed with how prepared I was. My confidence is through the roof at the moment. Now, excuse me while I go ride on this high for the rest of the day!

### Day 14: January 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked primarily on my Rails API for my final project at Flatiron. I wrote my README. I worked on the forecast_controller.rb as well as creating the forecast model and routes. I also discovered, studied, and implemented `responders gem`. I also started work on my React frontend.

**Thoughts**: I feel like I made great progress in regards to my API today. I learned something new (`responders gem`), which is always exciting and fun to me. I am happy that I decided to start on a different idea for this project. The last one had my mind clogged and I was stuck in the same position for a few days. Sometimes you just need to move on and come back to it later, which I will eventually.

### Day 15: January 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I relentlessly worked on my React project. I discovered a gem called `geocoder` and put it to use within my API. I also started work on my React components, actions, and reducer. I ended up deciding that I need to completely turn my API upside down and redo it, so that's fun! Stay tuned.

**Thoughts**: I truly felt like I made great progress today, but after discussing my app with my fiance, realized that I was doing my API completely wrong (structurally). That's the great thing about talking through things with others, you realize that you were making mistakes and have time to make adjustments.

### Day 16: January 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Skipped.

### Day 17: January 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked on trying to fix the issues with my API. I discovered that even the new way I wanted to do it wasn't going to work correctly. So, I wanted to start clean and created a new repo. I plan to fix the problems in the original repo after making sense of it with a clean repo.

**Thoughts**: Today was really frustrating and tears were shed. I got my hour completed and put the laptop away for the rest of the day hoping to come back with fresh eyes.

### Day 18: January 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked on Ruby interview prep problems on HackerRank. I went through 8 different problems over a span of 3 hours.

**Thoughts**: Some of the problems were simple and others required a lot of thought and logic. I decided to do my hour of code at the end of the day when my brain was a little foggy. I was having a hard time thinking things through, so hopefully tomorrow, when I practice before my mock technical interview, things go better.

### Day 19: January 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I got a lot accomplished today. I continued work on my Rails API, spent an hour working on Ruby kata's to prep for my mock technical interview, and I had my technical interview.

**Thoughts**: I think that I made positive progress in regards to my API. I am finding a lot of articles in regards to how I should build my database tables. I have a much more positive mindset in regards to my project compared to the last 3 days. My interview went well. The interviewer let me know that he thought I did a great job, but I'm still waiting on my official feedback so I can build my skills and fix the mistakes for my first real interview!

### Day 20: January 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Late last night I had an epiphany and thought, 'wait! I could make our wedding website and complete my project requirements!' So, today I built my rails API for this site. I have everything functioning the way an API should. I also mapped out how I want to build the frontend with React components.

**Thoughts**: I am really happy with my decision to pivot my project from the weather app to this wedding app. This is something that I've wanted to build. I've thought I'd always build our wedding website and this will at the least be great practice for it.

### Day 21: January 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I created my React frontend for my wedding website. I created the repo and added the necessary packages.

**Thoughts**: I had a very unproductive day. I was so excited when I sat everything down last night, but today I had a really hard time staying concentrated on one thing. One great thing is that I got my interview feedback and I am incredibly happy with it!!

### Day 22: January 25, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I created the guest list container, guest and guests components, as well as the rsvp form. I used reactstrap to create my form. I also removed the basic react templating and logos from the project. My containers and components have the most basic logic in them currently.

**Thoughts**: I am feeling good about today. I am happy with my decision to not make the containers and components too complex from the start, as I didn't want to get myself confused. I'm going to take this step by step slowly to make sure I am truly understanding what I am coding.

### Day 23: January 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I spent my hour brushing up on my algorithm skills for both, Ruby and Javascript. I worked on 4 Kata's on Codewars.

**Thoughts**: I felt fuzzy today and had a difficult time working on simple algorithms. It was a little frustrating, but considering how I felt, I'm happy with the outcome.

### Day 24: January 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I spent the day working on algorithm problems again on Codewars. I went through 2 Kata's using Ruby and 3 using Javacript.

**Thoughts**: I really like using my weekends as 'free' days to step away from my projects and study/brush up on my skills. I really enjoy getting to work on algorithms because it helps boost my confidence in my problem solving skills.

### Day 25: January 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I spent a decent amount of time reading up on redux-thunk and how I can incorporate it in my project. I also made changes to my rails API. I removed the ActiveRecord association between guests and rsvps, as well as removing guests altogether and placing the name and email attribute into rsvps.

**Thoughts**: I am feeling happy with my decision to remove the ActiveRecord association so that I do not need to deal with the messiness of a nested attribute form in React. I will eventually spend the time to learn how to do this in another project outside of bootcamp.

### Day 26: January 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I spent the morning in a study group focused on component lifecycles. The lead went through some great techniques to test the code and get an idea of when certain aspects of the component are firing/being called. So, I've spent the rest of my morning working on testing my components in the project to make sure I'm getting what I want, when I should be getting it.

**Thoughts**: I feel more confident in my understanding of components. I am having a hard time putting down the computer to eat lunch at the moment because I feel like I'm on a roll!

### Day 27: January 30, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I spent the entire day working on my wedding website project. I got the RSVP form structured properly using `reactstrap` and `bootstrap` packages. I also had to tweak a few things within the API, mostly routes and `rack-cors` gem info, in order to get the form to submit. I have it submitting and creating new instances of the ruby class, but is still sending back an error to the front end. I spent about an hour or so trying to debug this. No answer yet.

**Thoughts**: I felt like I did SO MUCH today, but in regards to the appearance of the web-app, it looks no different, except the form. I feel as if I've gotten a lot of the logic completed but I'm not rendering it to the page via HTML yet. Hopefully I'll make more progress in regards to this tomorrow. Also, hopefully I figure out this error that I'm getting quickly tomorrow with a fresh pair of eyes.

### Day 28: January 31, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I was able to fix the submission issue for my form today by fixing some syntax errors on the frontend and using `active_model_serializers` gem in the backend. I also began testing the other fetch requests I have written that will be utilized in the action files. These will be very helpful once I get the redux store up and running.

**Thoughts**: I feel really happy that I was able to fix the issue on my own. Of course it just conveniently clicked for me after posting on slack asking for help! HA. Now that I have my form working properly, I am going to concentrate on getting the redux store up and running properly.

### Day 29: February 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I spent the day continuing work on my wedding application. I spent about an hour and a half trying to find resources to figure out how to implement a Redux store in my project, but was still incredibly confused. I decided to focus on working on some styling as well as other simple stateless components.

**Thoughts**: I was really bothered by the fact that the Redux store information wasn't clicking for me. I had to sit it aside and decided to come back to it on Monday or over the weekend. I also had a random error occur with my form that wasn't occurring before. I hadn't changed any code in regards to my form or the RSVP controller so I have no idea why it is throwing this error. I am currently trying to clear my cache and see if that may have anything to do with it.

### Day 30: February 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I spent an hour in the morning working on freeCodeCamp's Javascript ES6 lessons.

**Thoughts**: I wish I would have found these lessons before my JS assessment, although I still did great. It's just the way that the information is laid out in the lessons. It's great!

**Link(s) to work**:
1. [freeCodeCamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/)

### Day 31: February 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I spent my hour of live coding refactoring an old project of my fiance's. He knows and codes in Python, which I do not know. I also worked on more Javascript ES6 lessons on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: It was really awesome having him let me try to interpret his code and then tell him what he could to make it cleaner. It's nice to be at the point, when it comes to software development, that I at points know better practices than him. It's also fun to see his code from when he first started coding. I realized that we all start somewhere, and it only goes up from there. I also like that Python is so very similar to Ruby, outside of being very different syntax-wise.

### Day 32: February 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I dove deep into Redux `store` articles today and realized that I had built my `store` correctly. I learned that I was actually misusing `mapStateToProps` and `mapDispatchToProps`. Once I got those coded differently, I started having an error in regards to my `componentDidMount` methods.

**Thoughts**: I was extremely happy to find out that I had built my `store` correctly. After reading and watching tutorials, forums, etc. I haven't figured out how to fix this error yet. Luckily, tomorrow is a new day!

### Day 33: February 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I spent the day trying to figure out why my `mapStateToProps` wasn't working properly. I watched multiple tutorials and read many articles attempting to find out what I've done wrong.

**Thoughts**: I learned that I am doing a lot of things right, but still haven't figured out what's causing certain pages to break. I come across people with the same errors but their fixes I already have completed correctly. It's been a rough day.

### Day 34: February 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I reached out to my technical lead to try and schedule a project support meeting. I attempted to watch more tutorials, but couldn't figure anything out. I decided to set my project aside for the day and jump back in to the JS curriculum of freeCodeCamp. I got through the first 16 lessons of the regex section.

**Thoughts**: I am a little flustered at the untimely responses from Flatiron employees who have been in charge of the last 2 sections. I just want help and always feel like I have to badger people multiple times a day on every platform to get them to finally reply. Luckily, I decided to spend the day being positive and trying to learn something I am not great at using, regex.

### Day 35: February 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I spent the day trying to debug my project, AGAIN, for the same `store`/`mapStateToProps` issue that I was having previously. I read a few more documents on debugging and common mistakes made.

**Thoughts**: I definitely keep gaining a deeper and deeper understanding of `react-redux` throughout this process, that's for sure. It slightly bothers me that I can't figure out the exact issue, but I know I am gaining valuable knowledge while trying to figure it out, so that makes it all okay! I finally have a project support meeting set up for tomorrow morning, so hopefully I am able to get this all squared away afterwards.

### Day 36: February 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I had a project support meeting this morning and it took all of 5 minutes to fix my code. All I had wrong was a small syntax problem. I was passing a prop variable to a child component without `{}` and that's why things weren't rendering properly from the children components. I spent the rest of my day refactoring and cleaning up my code. I also added a personalized thank you alert after someone rsvp's. With that said, I FINISHED MY PROJECT. All that is left is recording my walkthrough.

**Thoughts**: I am so happy. I felt so much relief and happiness when I learned that I didn't have to go through and fix a thousand different things to get my code to work properly. I felt so much relief when the tech lead told me that we laughed. Once I was off Zoom and told my fiance, I laughed so hard that I started crying. Such an amazing feeling to have the stress of this final project lifted off my shoulders. Now on to studying for the final assessment.

### Day 37: February 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today, I spent the day continuing my way through freeCodeCamp's Javascript curriculum. I completed the entirety of the 'Debugging' section and began working in the Algorithm section.

**Thoughts**: I was happy to concentrate on some basic Javascript skills. I learned about `console.clear()` for the first time today, which was a neat new thing I wasn't expecting to learn today!!

### Day 38: February 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I added an image of my fiance and I to the home/root page of our website. I added some CSS styling to the page. I created this all within a remote branch and did a pull request to combine it with the master branch.

**Thoughts**: This was something I wanted to do with the project, but it wasn't a requirement/top priority. I'm glad I now have the time to make these little changes. I'm excited to challenge myself in the future with aspects that I wasn't fully comfortable working on at first.

### Day 39: February 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I spent the day continuing my way through freeCodeCamp's Javascript curriculum. I worked within the 'Basic Data Structures' section as well as completed a few of the intermediate algorithm problems.  

**Thoughts**: Going through the basics of data structures again is really refreshing. There are tiny aspects of things that have slipped my mind, so it's nice to review!

### Day 40: February 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: While studying for my React assessment and attending two different study groups on Learn.co, I noticed a few mistakes that I had made in regards to my wedding website. I accidentally removed a reducer action case a few days ago that I didn't realize was still being called within my rsvpActions file. So, I added that switch case back into the reducer. I also realized why my image wasn't responding to my CSS styling. I wasn't utilizing JSX properly, so I fixed that and adjusted the image to my liking using CSS.

**Thoughts**: I am really happy that I am taking away a lot from these studying sessions for my upcoming assessment. It truly feels like I am understanding the concepts and able to implement them properly. I am trying so hard to make sure that I give the instructor absolutely no reason to not pass me. I want to graduate and move on to my job search SO BADLY!

### Day 41: February 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I spent 3 hours today continuing my work through freeCodeCamp's Javascript curriculum. I finished the 'Basic Data Structures' section and almost completed the 'Basic Algorithm Scripting'. Only 3 problems remain.

**Thoughts**: It was a long day of studying for my assessment as well as doing household chores. It was nice getting to spend a chunk of time working on sharpening my JS skills. It's currently almost 10:00pm and I wish I could finish this current section I'm working on. I'm just too worn out. Tomorrow is a new day!

### Day 42: February 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today, I spent the day studying for my React assessment, which just so happens to be my final bootcamp assessment. I passed!!!! I live coded with the instructor for an hour as well as wrote a blog post on `this.setState()` vs `this.state.KEY = VALUE`.

**Thoughts**: I am SOOOOO EXCITED. I am just waiting on my official "you've graduated" email from Flatiron. It is time to celebrate, then it's time to look for jobs!!!

### Day 43: February 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I spent 2 hours today continuing my work through freeCodeCamp's Javascript curriculum. I finished the 'Basic Algorithm Scripting' section as well as the 'Regular Expressions' section. I started working through the 'Object Oriented Programming' section.

**Thoughts**: I feel as if I got a lot done in only 2 hours! I am also happy that I only have 3 more sections remaining in this curriculum. I'm finishing things left and right and it makes me so incredibly happy.

### Day 44: February 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today, I spent an hour and a half continuing my work through freeCodeCamp's Javascript curriculum. I finished the 'Object Oriented Programming' section, which officially means I've completed 7 of 10 sections. I also started working through the 'Functional Programming' section.

**Thoughts**: I feel like I blew through the OO programming section because that is a huge aspect that Flatiron always pushed when teaching JS. It makes me feel confident in those skills. Now, with this new functional programming section, I believe it'll be a tough one for me. I completed the first 7 challenges today and some of them weren't easy for me.

### Day 45: February 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: During my assessment the other day, the instructor pointed out that whenever a component was rendered via clicking my navbar links the page was reloading. So, today I spent my 2.5 hours learning and implementing how to utilize both, `reactstrap` and `react-router-dom` together. I also learned and implemented how to redirect to another component after form submission.

**Thoughts**: I wish figuring out the issues in my code always happened this easily! This is the first time I've really worked on a project after submission for this long. I still have so many ideas and I want to play around with the styling some more.

### Day 46: February 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I spent my hour of code by working on Ruby kata's on CodeWars. I completed 7 kata's within the hour.

**Thoughts**: I did the easiest kata's (8kyu), but I felt really great about how easy they were to work through. My answers are starting to fall inline with the 'best practice' solutions.

### Day 48: February 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I spent my day today learning Gatsby.js because I plan to build my portfolio project with it. There are 9 parts to this tutorial and I completed the first 4, parts 0-3. These parts focused on setting up the environment and on the basics of Gatsby.

**Thoughts**: I feel as if working with Gatsby will help me better understand React components. I am excited to continue working through the rest of the tutorial and then start building my portfolio.

### Day 49: February 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued working on the Gatsby.js tutorial. I completed parts 4 and 5, which focus on GraphQL and how to incorporate it into a Gatsby project. I also learned about GraphiQL, which is GraphQL's developer tool.

**Thoughts**: I really liked learning about GraphQL and GraphiQL. I am interested in possibly learning the ins and outs of GraphQL now. I've only known SQL and SQLite, so it's nice to get exposure to something new.

### Day 50: February 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I spent my hour of code continuing work on the Gatsby.js tutorial. I completed parts 6, 7, and 8 which continued focusing on GraphQL, how to programmatically create pages from data, and how to prepare a site to go live.

**Thoughts**: I am officially finished with the tutorial and excited to start planning out my portfolio site.

### Day 51: February 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I spent 6 hours between midnight and 1:00pm helping my fiance build a chrome extension using javascript. He buys and sells tickets on StubHub and always switches from one page to the next to the next to see all the info he needs in order to determine if the purchase is worth it. So, we create a chrome extension that allows him to see all the information on the on game ticket listings page.

**Thoughts**: It was awesome getting to teach him stuff that he never knew. He even cried a little bit because of how proud he is of me. So, I'd say it's been a good day coding wise.

### Day 52: February 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I spent my hour of code today working through algorithm problems on CodeWars as well as started the 10 days of code challenge on HackerRank. I also started the "Ruby Tutorial" on accident, thinking it was more complex concepts. May work through it to review basics.  

**Thoughts**: I really wasn't feeling it today and almost didn't complete my hour of code. I buckled down and got it done though, so I'm happy with myself. I also got a lot done in one hour, which makes me feel confident in my skills that I worked on today.

### Day 53: February 25, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I spent the day today creating a weather web-app using only React. I learned how to hide and call an API key within a React app. I finished the basics of the site today, but there is very little styling. My hope is to work on the styling tomorrow.   

**Thoughts**: This is my first time creating a sole React web-application and it is definitely different than a React-Redux application. It took some adjustment in the way I was thinking the set up would be originally, but I got it all figured out!

### Day 54: February 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on the styling portion of my weather app. I definitely need to update the CSS again so that it can be a responsive layout, but at full screen it looks great at the moment. More work for another day.

**Thoughts**: This is the first time I've really dived into the UI of a website and it was definitely not easy. I am excited to learn more and get more experience with UI. It definitely does not come naturally to me.

### Day 55: February 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I only coded for the one hour today. I continued working through the Javascript curriculum on freeCodeCamp. I completed 7 of the 'Functional Programming' lessons. I also worked through some of the problems on HackerRank's 10 days of JS and 30 days of Coding challenges.  

**Thoughts**: I worked out this afternoon and felt pretty much dead afterwards which made me really regret not getting my hour of code in beforehand. It was a struggle to get through as much as I did. Tomorrow will be a new day and I'll try to work on making the weather projects CSS responsive.

### Day 56: February 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: In an effort to create a responsive layout for my weather caster project, I started working through freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification after not touching it for about a year. I completed the whole 'Applied Visual Design' section.

**Thoughts**: I really enjoyed creating a heart with CSS and making it beat. I learned A LOT today about CSS that I never knew. I'm super excited to continue learning more about design. I hope that this helps design come to me a little bit easier than at the moment.

### Day 57: March 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued working through the responsive web design cert on freeCodeCamp. I completed the 'Applied Accessibility', 'Responsive Web Design Principles', and 'CSS Flexbox' sections.

**Thoughts**: I am only 2 sections off of completing the certification and getting that under my belt, which excites me. I like the fact that I'm taking a deeper dive into a language I already know.

### Day 58: March 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I finally found a layout that I liked enough to build my first portfolio site base on. Luckily enough, the developer made it a starter-kit and I've officially got my site started! I am building it using the Gatsby starter-kit and Contentful.

**Thoughts**: I am excited to personalize this layout with my links and colors that I'd like to use. Hopefully I'm not too picky about colors and it doesn't take me forever to find and choose them. I am also excited to get to know Contentful and officially start posting on Medium. So far, I've only used Flatiron's blog domain they provided for us as students.

### Day 59: March 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I continued working on my portfolio site today. I picked out colors for my theme and started changing out the content on Contentful. I uploaded an image of myself and replaced all the social links with my own personal links. I also added all of my projects but still need to screenshot pictures for them.

**Thoughts**: Right at the end I changed the Medium username from the default one to mine and it made everything break since I have no articles published. So, tomorrow I am going to attempt to publish a few of my Flatiron blog posts to Medium and see if that fixes things!
