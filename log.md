# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I made the final touches on a project by reviewing my code, testing the code to double check all variables that are declared are being used, and confirming that I made use of ES6 syntax. I also completed 2 Javascript Kata's on Codewars.

**Thoughts**: I am happy to be completing the basic requirements of this project, but even more excited about the fact that my mind is constantly rolling with new ideas/features I could add to it in the future.

<!-- ### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
