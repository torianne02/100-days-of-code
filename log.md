# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I made the final touches on a project by reviewing my code, testing the code to double check all variables that are declared are being used, and confirming that I made use of ES6 syntax. I also completed 2 Javascript Kata's on Codewars.

**Thoughts**: I am happy to be completing the basic requirements of this project, but even more excited about the fact that my mind is constantly rolling with new ideas/features I could add to it in the future.

### Day 2: January 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I completed 6 Kata's on Codewars, in Javascript and Ruby.

**Thoughts** I have felt like I need some practice communicating my code and thought processes while trying to work through a problem, so I volunteered my fiance to verbally work through a few Kata's with me. It was very helpful to learn what to say and not to say. It was also great getting in the practice of coding through a few problems with a partner.
