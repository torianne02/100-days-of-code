# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 2 - [Victoria Fluharty]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [May 1, 2019].

## Log

### R2D1
For the first day, I worked on the styling for my portfolio project. I worked specifically on the CSS and Reactstrap on my projects page and navbar. Today, I learned how to align a navbar in Reactstrap to the right.

### R2D2
I continued working on my portfolio project today. I moved on to my about me page. I added an image and made use of CSS and Reactstrap. I am having difficulties getting the CSS to respond the way I'd like it to. I'm seeing a lot of video tutorials in my future.

### R2D3
Today I spent my hour of code working through JavaScript problems on HackerRank. I also worked on my portfolio project. I'm still working on getting the layout to be responsive, so lots of CSS and reactstrap being used at the moment.

### R2D4
May the 4th be with you! :lightsaber: ... I successfully figured out how to make my text size responsive by using `vw` vs `px`. I also added my stack to my about me page. My portfolio is coming along. Next step is finishing my about me page and moving on to my contact page, which will be a challenge.

### R2D5
Today I spent the day trying to work through algorithms on HackerRank. I tried 3, but only got 1 completed. My fiance and I did a 13 mile hike this morning and I've been exhausted. Brain didn't function well.

### R2D6
I took another crack at the problems I had a hard time working through yesterday because I was so tired. I completed them!! In total, I completed 5 JavaScript algorithm problems on HackerRank. This is my first day getting that many problems completed in over a month. I'm finally starting to feel like myself again.

### R2D7
I spent my hour today completing more algorithm questions on HackerRank. I completed 3 more problems today.

### R2D8
I went back to making progress on my portfolio site. I am still having difficulty getting my logo image sizes to be responsive. I did figure out what I was doing wrong in regards to changing the background color. I also found the color palette I want and began implementing it.

### R2D9
I decided to spend the day reviewing the basics of Ruby and Javascript. I went over the creation of classes and class methods. I worked on Repl.it and accidentally didn't save the repl's. Oops!

### R2D10
I received a take home coding challenge after a successful video IV. I have spent about 3 hours on it so far today. My task is to build a Ruby API without utilizing Rails, so I'm attempting to use Sinatra and Grape to accomplish this. Building a Ruby app from scratch again without any help has definitely been a bit of a challenge. I needed to shake some dust off of the ol' brain here.

### R2D11
I continued working on the take home coding challenge. I was able to get the API fully functioning with Grape, ActiveRecord, and Sinatra. I need to use Sequel instead of ActiveRecord though, so I'll be learning and incorporating that tomorrow.

### R2D12
Today I learned about and implemented Sequel into my project. I successfully finished building the API using Sequel, Grape, and Sinatra. I had to use algorithm logic within the API endpoints to display the return the correct data sets.

### R2D13
I started working on the React frontend of this take home coding assignment. I successfully completed the whole thing by midnight. I used reactstrap to add minimal styling to the site. I also wrote the README in detail.

### R2D14
I attempted to import a CSV file to my database within the project. I couldn't get it to work properly though and submitted the assessment. I included the commented out code that had my logic though.

### R2D15
After coding a ton over the last few days, I decided to take today easy. I attempted to work on some coding algorithms, but was having a difficult time thinking through anything. I ended up reading a few blog posts about solving algorithms and participated in CodeNewbies weekly discussion.

### R2D16
Today I didn't accomplish any live coding, as I was busy packing and cleaning up for my upcoming trip to EDC. I did however, get some reading done at the airport before my flight about general computer science information (stacks, queues, etc.).

### R2D17
I am camping at EDC but still found time to code for an hour. My fiance sat down with me (since we had no WIFI) and gave me tasks. I built a deck of cards in ruby as well as shuffling and dealing methods.

### R2D18
I skipped this day, was at EDC. :(

### R2D21
I picked back up on my portfolio project. I created the contact form today, as well as the container for it. The form will not display on the page right now and I can't figure out why. A task to tackle tomorrow. I also created a thank you card to display after someone submits the contact form.

### R2D22
Today I prepared for my interview tomorrow morning by reviewing my coding assignment. I refactored some of the code and made sure I can explain it all.

### R2D23
I spent an hour this morning during my interview discussing and refactoring my code. I also worked on my portfolio site for 2 hours. I am so close to being finished. The only thing I have left is connecting GMAIL. I finally figured out how to get my images responsive and fixed the reason why my contact form wasn't appearing.

### R2D24
I decided to add a my interests section to my portfolio so I made some adjustments to the components today. I created a home component for my initial introduction. I placed my stack info and interests in my about me component. I also added a navbar brand. I still need to figure out how to add GMAIL to my site.
