## Log

### R2D1
For the first day, I worked on the styling for my portfolio project. I worked specifically on the CSS and Reactstrap on my projects page and navbar. Today, I learned how to align a navbar in Reactstrap to the right.

### R2D2
I continued working on my portfolio project today. I moved on to my about me page. I added an image and made use of CSS and Reactstrap. I am having difficulties getting the CSS to respond the way I'd like it to. I'm seeing a lot of video tutorials in my future.

### R2D3
Today I spent my hour of code working through JavaScript problems on HackerRank. I also worked on my portfolio project. I'm still working on getting the layout to be responsive, so lots of CSS and reactstrap being used at the moment.

### R2D4
May the 4th be with you! :lightsaber: ... I successfully figured out how to make my text size responsive by using `vw` vs `px`. I also added my stack to my about me page. My portfolio is coming along. Next step is finishing my about me page and moving on to my contact page, which will be a challenge.

### R2D5
Today I spent the day trying to work through algorithms on HackerRank. I tried 3, but only got 1 completed. My fiance and I did a 13 mile hike this morning and I've been exhausted. Brain didn't function well.

### R2D6
I took another crack at the problems I had a hard time working through yesterday because I was so tired. I completed them!! In total, I completed 5 JavaScript algorithm problems on HackerRank. This is my first day getting that many problems completed in over a month. I'm finally starting to feel like myself again.

### R2D7
I spent my hour today completing more algorithm questions on HackerRank. I completed 3 more problems today.

### R2D8
I went back to making progress on my portfolio site. I am still having difficulty getting my logo image sizes to be responsive. I did figure out what I was doing wrong in regards to changing the background color. I also found the color palette I want and began implementing it.

### R2D9
I decided to spend the day reviewing the basics of Ruby and Javascript. I went over the creation of classes and class methods. I worked on Repl.it and accidentally didn't save the repl's. Oops!

### R2D10
I received a take home coding challenge after a successful video IV. I have spent about 3 hours on it so far today. My task is to build a Ruby API without utilizing Rails, so I'm attempting to use Sinatra and Grape to accomplish this. Building a Ruby app from scratch again without any help has definitely been a bit of a challenge. I needed to shake some dust off of the ol' brain here.
