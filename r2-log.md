The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [May 1, 2019].

## Log

### R2D1
For the first day, I worked on the styling for my portfolio project. I worked specifically on the CSS and Reactstrap on my projects page and navbar. Today, I learned how to align a navbar in Reactstrap to the right.

### R2D2
I continued working on my portfolio project today. I moved on to my about me page. I added an image and made use of CSS and Reactstrap. I am having difficulties getting the CSS to respond the way I'd like it to. I'm seeing a lot of video tutorials in my future.

### R2D3
Today I spent my hour of code working through JavaScript problems on HackerRank. I also worked on my portfolio project. I'm still working on getting the layout to be responsive, so lots of CSS and reactstrap being used at the moment.
