### R1D11
Tomorrow I have a Javascript assessment for my JS final project. I decided to spend the day today studying and practicing variable hoisting and function hoisting. I did all my practice problems using repl.it.

### R1D12
Today I had the first half of my assessment for Javascript. I had to walk through my project and do some live coding. I was tasked with adding a 'sort' button to the current users beer list. I created an event listener using jQuery and retrieved the JSON data needed via an AJAX call. I then used existing code to display the information onto the view page. I also studied more for the JS fundamental portion of the assessment.

### R1D13
Today I had the second half of my assessment for Javascript. The second half is geared towards JS/ES6 fundamentals. We reviewed arrow functions, variable declarations using var, const, and let, hoisting, scope, this, and closures. I have also worked on a whole entire new REACT project and getting that API call sorted out.
