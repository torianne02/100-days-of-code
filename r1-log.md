### R1D11
Tomorrow I have a Javascript assessment for my JS final project. I decided to spend the day today studying and practicing variable hoisting and function hoisting. I did all my practice problems using repl.it.

### R1D12
Today I had the first half of my assessment for Javascript. I had to walk through my project and do some live coding. I was tasked with adding a 'sort' button to the current users beer list. I created an event listener using jQuery and retrieved the JSON data needed via an AJAX call. I then used existing code to display the information onto the view page. I also studied more for the JS fundamental portion of the assessment.

[PintTrackr](https://github.com/torianne02/pint-trackr-rails-js)

### R1D13
Today I had the second half of my assessment for Javascript. The second half is geared towards JS/ES6 fundamentals. We reviewed arrow functions, variable declarations using var, const, and let, hoisting, scope, this, and closures. I have also worked on a whole entire new REACT project and getting that API call sorted out.

[Weather-Cast API](https://github.com/torianne02/weather-cast-api)

### R1D14
Today I worked on my Rails API for my final project at Flatiron. I wrote my README. I worked on the forecast_controller.rb as well as creating the forecast model and routes. I also discovered, studied, and implemented `responders gem`. I began working on the React frontend of my project as well.

[Weather-Caster API](https://github.com/torianne02/weather-cast-api)

[Weather-Caster Frontend](https://github.com/torianne02/weather-cast-frontend)

### R1D15
I spent the day today continue work on my react project. I came across the `responders gem` which I put to use within my Rails API. After working for hours on the frontend react components, reducer, and actions, I realized something wasn't right. I discussed it with my fiance and it turns out I need to change my rails API structure. Tons of fun!

### R1D16
SKIPPED

### R1D17
I attempted to fix my API issue from the day before. I ended up getting very flustered and decided to create a clean repo to try and start from scratch. I want to work through the whole process again from the start to see where I went wrong. I will then go and fix the current API.

### R1D20
Today I pivoted my final project yet again. I had an exciting thought last night that I'd build my wedding website! This is great because I know I am passionate about this project. It's going to drive my creativity and hopefully keep my head clear. I created my Rails API today and also mapped out my plans for my React frontend. I'm excited to work on it tomorrow!

[Crawford-Wedding-API](https://github.com/torianne02/crawford-wedding-api)

### R1D21
I created my frontend for the wedding website. I created the repo and added the necessary packages. I also got my feedback for my mock interview and I am very pleased!!

[Crawford-Wedding-Frontend](https://github.com/torianne02/crawford-wedding-frontend)

### R1D22
I worked on creating containers and components for the guest and rsvp aspect of my React frontend. I created the most basic templates for each container and component. I also use reactstrap to create my RSVP form.

[Crawford-Wedding-Frontend](https://github.com/torianne02/crawford-wedding-frontend)

### R1D23
Today I spent my hour brushing up on my algorithm skills for both, Ruby and Javascript. I worked on 4 Kata's on Codewars.

### R1D24
I decided to spend my free time away from my projects and working on algorithms after having a hard time with them yesterday. Luckily, I felt much better today and worked on a few of the problems that I immediately brushed off yesterday as 'too hard.' I feel accomplished and pleased with my progress.

### R1D25
I spent the day reading up on `redux-thunk` so that I can incorporate it in my project. I also decided to make a change in my Rails API. I removed the ActiveRecord association between guests and rsvps. I removed guests and added the name and email attribute to rsvps, this way I won't have a nested attributes relationship.

[Crawford-Wedding-API](https://github.com/torianne02/crawford-wedding-api)

### R1D26
I worked on testing within my code with `console.log()` to get a full understanding of when each aspect is called within a component/container. I was in a study group first thing in the morning that discussed components and their lifecycle. It was very beneficial for me due to the point I am at in my project!!  

[Crawford-Wedding-Frontend](https://github.com/torianne02/crawford-wedding-frontend)

### R1D27
I accomplished a lot today in regards to the background code that doesn't appear on the actual web page. I also designed my RSVP form using `reactstrap` and `bootstrap`. I am able to submit the form using a fetch request but I am still getting a `500 server error` after the instance of the ruby class in created and saved. Hopefully with a pair of fresh eyes tomorrow, I will be able to successfully debug this issue and get more stateless components completed.  

[Crawford-Wedding-Frontend](https://github.com/torianne02/crawford-wedding-frontend)

[Crawford-Wedding-API](https://github.com/torianne02/crawford-wedding-api)

### R1D28
Today I was able to fix the problem I was having with my form submission yesterday. After a lot of tweaking and asking for help via slack, I realized that the the parameters weren't being sent to the API properly. 2 of the attributes weren't being included in the params and it kept causing the form to fail. Luckily enough, it was just a few minor syntax adjustments and the addition of a serializer that needed to take place! Now I have a form that submits to the API and send back the information to the frontend. I am now concentrating on getting the redux store up and running properly.

[Crawford-Wedding-Frontend](https://github.com/torianne02/crawford-wedding-frontend)

[Crawford-Wedding-API](https://github.com/torianne02/crawford-wedding-api)

### R1D29
I spent the morning attempting to understand where I was going wrong in regards to my Redux store, but nothing was clicking for me. I decided to put that down and work on more stateless components for the website, since those were easy enough. I also used more `reactstrap` and CSS to add more styling to my web page.

[Crawford-Wedding-Frontend](https://github.com/torianne02/crawford-wedding-frontend)

### R1D30
I spent my hour working through Javascript ES6 lessons on freeCodeCamp. I have learned little things, such as destructuring assignments, that I didn't even know ES6 brought to the table. It has been really beneficial in deepening my knowledge of JS.

[freeCodeCamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/)

### R1D31
Today I spent the day refactoring some of my fiance's old code from when he first started coding. It was fun seeing the silly little mistakes he made like using Arrays instead of dictionaries/objects. He codes in Python, so it isn't what I know specifically, but it was great getting exposure to the fact that Ruby and Python are fundamentally similar. I also continued working through freeCodeCamp's JS ES6 lessons.

### R1D32
I dove deep into figuring out the Redux store in my wedding website project. I realized that I had built my store correctly the whole time, but I was using `mapStateToProps` and `mapDispatchToProps` incorrectly. Once I started to write them correctly, I realized the `componentDidMount` functions were throwing errors. Lots of research has occurred with no answers thus far.

[Crawford-Wedding-Frontend](https://github.com/torianne02/crawford-wedding-frontend)

### R1D33
I still couldn't figure out why the `mapStateToProps` isn't working. I spent the whole day going through trial and error while watching so many tutorials and got nowhere. I know I am doing things right, but I don't know what I'm doing wrong yet. Tomorrow is a new day.

[Crawford-Wedding-Frontend](https://github.com/torianne02/crawford-wedding-frontend)

### R1D34
I reached out for help with my project today, but I haven't heard back. So, I decided to spend my hour of code working on freeCodeCamp's Javascript curriculum some more. I made it through the first 16 lessons of regex, which I've always been awful with. It's definitely beneficial.

[freeCodeCamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/)

### R1D35
I spent yet another day trying to debug my issue with `store` and `mapStateToProps`. I read a few more articles on common mistakes made and debugging. I definitely have a deeper understanding of `react-redux` but, unfortunately, haven't come up with a solution for my code yet.

[Crawford-Wedding-Frontend](https://github.com/torianne02/crawford-wedding-frontend)

### R1D36
I COMPLETED ALL MY PROJECT REQUIREMENTS! WOOHOO! Alright, now that the celebration is out there, let's get serious. I had a project support meeting this morning and it took all of 5 minutes to fix my code. All I had wrong was a small syntax problem. I was passing a prop variable to a child component without `{}` and that's why things weren't rendering properly from the children components. So, after that I made all the final adjustments to my project, like cleaning up the code, refactoring, and adding a thank you alert after someone RSVP's!

[Crawford-Wedding-Frontend](https://github.com/torianne02/crawford-wedding-frontend)

[Crawford-Wedding-API](https://github.com/torianne02/crawford-wedding-api)

### R1D37
Today I worked through more of freeCodeCamp's Javascript curriculum. I completed the entire debugging section and began working within the intermediate algorithm section. I learned about `console.clear()` for the first time today.

[freeCodeCamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/)

### R1D38
Today, I added an image of my fiance and I to the home page of our wedding website. I included some CSS styling for the image. I also worked with a remote branch and then completed a pull request. I haven't done this often, so it was great practice.

[Crawford-Wedding-Frontend](https://github.com/torianne02/crawford-wedding-frontend)

### R1D39
I spent my hour of code continuing work within freeCodeCamp's Javascript curriculum. I worked within the 'Basic Data Structures' section as well as a few problems within the intermediate algorithm section.

[freeCodeCamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/)

### R1D40
After attending two study groups on Learn.co as well as reading a bunch of articles on React, I discovered a few issues within my wedding website project. I had to go through and refactor some code, which was incredibly beneficial to my understanding of the topics. More details on my exact mistakes can be found in the `log.md` file.

[Crawford-Wedding-Frontend](https://github.com/torianne02/crawford-wedding-frontend)

### R1D41
I spent 3 hours working on freeCodeCamp's Javascript curriculum today. I completed the 'Basic Data Structures' section and almost completed the 'Basic Algorithm Scripting' section. 3 more problems left!

[freeCodeCamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/)

### R1D42
I studied all morning for my React assessment, which included me doing so practice coding. I had my assessment and live coded with the instructor for about an hour. I PASSED!!!! I am so excited to start my job search and celebrate! Oh, and I also wrote a blog post about why we need to use `this.setState()` instead of `this.state.KEY = VALUE`. Productive day!

[Why Do We Use this.setState()?](http://torrnadoscodingadventures.com/why_do_we_use_this_setstate)

### R1D43
I spent almost a whole 2 hours working through freeCodeCamp's Javascript curriculum. I went back and completed the regex section and also finished the basic algorithm scripting section. I began working on the object oriented programming section and am really happy that I'm inching closer to finishing the curriculum.

[freeCodeCamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/)

### R1D44
Today, I spent an hour and a half on freeCodeCamp's JS curriculum. I completed the OO programming section and started working on the functional programming section. I believe this section is going to be one of the most challenging so far for me. I'm excited to keep working through it.

[freeCodeCamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/)

### R1D45
During my assessment the other day, the instructor pointed out that my pages were refreshing anytime a new component was rendered. So, today I spent my 2.5 hours of code figuring out how to work with `react-router-dom` and `reactstrap` together. Turns out, I only needed to import `Link` from `react-router-dom`. I also learned how to redirect to another component when criteria is met. I worked on a new branch to redirect to my ThankYou component rather than rendering it and styling it as an alert. I used the card styling via `reactstrap` and some CSS to style it instead.

[Crawford-Wedding-Frontend](https://github.com/torianne02/crawford-wedding-frontend)

### R1D46
I spent my hour of code today by completing Katas on CodeWars. I worked through 7 problems, all in Ruby. I felt really happy at how easy it was to work through them and how my solutions are starting to line up with the 'best practice' solutions.

### R1D48
I spent my day today working through the Gatsby tutorial. I plan to make my portfolio website utilizing Gatsby, so I figured this would be a good place to start. I completed parts 0-3, which focused on setting up the development environment and general Gatsby information/layout.

https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/

### R1D49
For my hour of code today, I continued working through the Gatsby tutorial. I completed parts 4 and 5, which specifically focused on Gatsby and it's relationship with GraphQL and its developer tool GraphiQL. This has really peaked my interest in GraphQL.

https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/

### R1D50
Today I spent my hour finishing up the Gatsby tutorial. I completed parts 6, 7, and 8 which continued focusing on GraphQL, as well as programmatically creating pages and preparing a site to go live. I am excited to start planning the layout of my portfolio site now!

https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/

### R1D51
Today I have spent many hours, from 12:00am - 1:30am as well as 8:00am - 1:00pm, helping my fiance create a chrome extension using javascript. He buys and sells tickets on StubHub, so we created an extension to display details like the face values of tickets and whatnot on the actual game ticket listings page. I've taught him a lot today.

### R1D52
I really wasn't feeling it today and almost didn't even start my hour of code, but here I am an hour later updating! I got a lot done in the hour. I worked on algorithms on CodeWars and also started the 10 day Javascript challenge on HackerRank. I also accidentally started working on the Ruby tutorial on HackerRank thinking it was more complex. I may continue working through it to review basics. I am proud of how much I accomplished in the hour I didn't even want to start.
