### R1D11
Tomorrow I have a Javascript assessment for my JS final project. I decided to spend the day today studying and practicing variable hoisting and function hoisting. I did all my practice problems using repl.it.

### R1D12
Today I had the first half of my assessment for Javascript. I had to walk through my project and do some live coding. I was tasked with adding a 'sort' button to the current users beer list. I created an event listener using jQuery and retrieved the JSON data needed via an AJAX call. I then used existing code to display the information onto the view page. I also studied more for the JS fundamental portion of the assessment.

### R1D13
Today I had the second half of my assessment for Javascript. The second half is geared towards JS/ES6 fundamentals. We reviewed arrow functions, variable declarations using var, const, and let, hoisting, scope, this, and closures. I have also worked on a whole entire new REACT project and getting that API call sorted out.

[Weather-Cast API](https://github.com/torianne02/weather-cast-api)


### R1D14
Today I worked on my Rails API for my final project at Flatiron. I wrote my README. I worked on the forecast_controller.rb as well as creating the forecast model and routes. I also discovered, studied, and implemented `responders gem`. I began working on the React frontend of my project as well.

### R1D15
I spent the day today continue work on my react project. I came across the `responders gem` which I put to use within my Rails API. After working for hours on the frontend react components, reducer, and actions, I realized something wasn't right. I discussed it with my fiance and it turns out I need to change my rails API structure. Tons of fun!

### R1D16
SKIPPED

### R1D17
I attempted to fix my API issue from the day before. I ended up getting very flustered and decided to create a clean repo to try and start from scratch. I want to work through the whole process again from the start to see where I went wrong. I will then go and fix the current API.

### R1D20
Today I pivoted my final project yet again. I had an exciting thought last night that I'd build my wedding website! This is great because I know I am passionate about this project. It's going to drive my creativity and hopefully keep my head clear. I created my Rails API today and also mapped out my plans for my React frontend. I'm excited to work on it tomorrow!

### R1D24
I decided to spend my free time away from my projects and working on algorithms after having a hard time with them yesterday. Luckily, I felt much better today and worked on a few of the problems that I immediately brushed off yesterday as 'too hard.' I feel accomplished and pleased with my progress.
